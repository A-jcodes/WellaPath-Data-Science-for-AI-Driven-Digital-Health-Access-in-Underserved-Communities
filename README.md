**Project Summary**

This project simulates a real-world health-tech deployment scenario where insufficient medical data required the creation of a structured synthetic dataset to enable machine learning–based disease classification.

I worked within the Data Science team supporting the development of an AI-assisted symptom triage system for WellaPath, a digital health platform serving underserved populations in Nigeria.

The objective was to classify patient symptom profiles into 7 common diseases using supervised ML models and determine the most reliable algorithm for downstream deployment.
